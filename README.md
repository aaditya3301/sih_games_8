  - *Features*: Combos, lives, scoring, beautiful UI, physics-based gameplay.
  - *Tech*: Canvas rendering, React/Next.js hooks, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
  - *Curriculum*: Number systems, perfect squares, square roots, pattern recognition.

- **Interest Calc**  
  Calculate interest through interactive activities. (Details to be expanded based on code implementation.)

### 🟩 Science Games
- **Friction Racers**  
  Explore the concept of friction and motion by racing objects with different surfaces.
  - *Objective*: Test how friction affects movement in a gamified race.
  - *Tech*: Interactive UI, physics simulation.
  - *Curriculum*: Physics - force, friction, motion.

- **Metal Mayhem**  
  Learn about metals and their properties through fun challenges.
  - *Objective*: Answer quizzes or solve puzzles about metals.
  - *Tech*: Quiz/puzzle system, responsive UI.
  - *Curriculum*: Chemistry - metals, reactions, properties.
